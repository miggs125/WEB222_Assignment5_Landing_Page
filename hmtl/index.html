                                climbing on real rock. Learn how to inspect rock, practice route finding skills,
                                determine and mitigate risk factors, gear clean-up and gear inspection.

                            <p>Traditional climbing, as opposed to sport climbing, has no bolts fixed on the wall.
                                climbers carry their own gear made up of slings, steel wedge nuts and camming devices
                                that are placed inside cracks.
